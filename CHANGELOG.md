### Fixed
- using `BaseCacheImpl` as subclass was cause NotImplementedError, but now fixed.

### Improved
All of caches improved and their perfomance improved a lot.

## 3.1.0 - 2024-06-06
### Added
- Now supports `pickle`
- a little document added to Rust code

### Changed
- `VTTLCache`: uses `time::SystemTime` instead of `time::Instant` ( doesn't effect python codes, don't care )

## 3.0.0 - 2024-06-02

### Changed
- `__repr__` changed to `__str__`
- Maxsize system changed; when you pass `0` as maxsize, the value of `sys.maxsize` is automatically used.
- `__eq__` and `__ne__` behaviors changed
- Iterators mechanisms changed:
    - Now uses pointer to hashmap and iterate it
    - Additional spaces are removed
    - Caches cannot change while using iterators
- hashing machanism changed; now we cache hashes for elements to improve speed
- `Cache` was rewritten:
    - Now we use low-level API of hashbrown hashmap.
    - We removed additional layers to improve speed and performance.
- `FIFOCache` was rewritten:
    - The additional memory space removed
    - Keeping items order system changed
    - popitem, last, and first methods optimized
